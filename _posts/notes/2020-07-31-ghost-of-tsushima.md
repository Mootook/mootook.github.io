# Ghost of Tsushima [WIP]
---

## Cinematic Visuals - [WIP]
Most aspects of GoT seem in service of its visual style (Akira Kurosawa films)
- No number on leveling up (pros and cons)
- Camera positioning
- Amazing intro that does better than any game in recent memory of setting its tone
- Mission intro screens
- Waypoints (the wind) and guiding markers (birds/foxes) seem to be a nod to the cinematic motion of Kurosawa

Favorite thing about GoT is the subtle 'leveling up', the game allows for. There's a skill tree, but the only indication of experience or player level is the white icon that fills up after missions. Progression feels organic, challenges seem aspirational and not impossible, flush with both the narrative and gameplay.

## Side-Quests

A great chunk of GoT is composed of episodic missions that, for the most part, are tangential to the main story but provide incentive through through material rewards (crafting supplies, armor upgrades), experience to level up, and narrative arcs with supporting characters.

There are three "types" of side-quests:  

**Major** -- often multi-part, focusing on the development of a side character's story (Sensei Ishikawa and the hunt for his student Tomoe, for example). These are brought to the player's attention through the narrative progression of the main story. Rewards include materials, upgrade components, or key weapons/items/armor.

**Minor** -- self-contained, short missions focusing on external (to Jin) events that, if left unattended, don't seem to effect to the main gameplay arc. Often brought to the attention of the player through exploration or guided interaction with the world (broken cart on a main path, golden bird guiding you to distraught villager, speech bubble over villager).
Rewards include materials and upgrade components.

**Mythical** -- self contained, medium length missions focusing on an ancient legend that tend to involve a piece of armor, weapon, or new attack method (strong incentive for player. Aligns narrative goal of quest with tangible reward). Introduced much like minor quests but only through village musician/story-tellers. Rewards include armor, weapons, additions to skill tree.

### Minor Side-Quests and Small Arena Level Design

#### Minor Side-Quest Structure

"The Cost of Iron", a quest which can be completed in the first act showcases a lot of the qualities of a "minor side-quest". It's short with a self-contained narrative, it offers a few low-impact rewards, and its completion is entirely optional (and is presented as such).  

You start of at the initial way-point, a hut sheltering a group of merchants who unveil the story of an iron mark possessed by another local merchant. The mark, they say, enables its carrier to travel safely among Mongols. Your goal is to find this local merchant and the iron mark he possesses.

A brief "tracking" style progression ensues --> investigate the scene that the merchants point you towards, fight some Mongols, return to the merchants to find them dead/dying, track the killers, kill them, rescue the merchant. Done.

This progression, from listening to merchants then to rescuing one from the Mongols is a pretty typical minor side quest in both narrative and gameplay progression.  

- The narrative is simple and only needs the context of the game's central plot point (Mongols have invaded Tsushima and are wrecking havoc across the land) to be explained.
- The story has a singular motive and doesn't appear to have implications beyond itself (The iron mark does not change gameplay, the rescued merchant is not seen again).
  - The player can choose to ignore this mission and there isn't a lingering sense of guilt or unfinished business because the plight and reward for completion are almost trivial compared to the stake's of the main mission or major side-quests.  

No promise of a reward is made by the NPC who initiates the quest. So the main motivation for completion are the few rewards promised by the mission info (usually supplies or some material needed for upgrades) in the start menu or just player experience (legend growth, in terms of the game's largely abstracted leveling mechanic).  

The progression of gameplay is generally pretty formulaic in minor side-quests and, with some slight variations, can be illustrated as such:  

![flowchart](./images/ghost-of-tsushima/cost-of-iron/flowchart.svg){: .post-image}  

This, as a general template, makes up a majority of minor side-quests structures. Variations are not necessarily in the directional flow but, at times, in the order (after the initial way-point) and in the repetition of certain gameplay blocks. Some will have more than one tracking segment; some will have multiple fights; sometimes the fight interrupts another segment; sometimes there is no fight at all.  
But all of them are self-contained. They start and end within one mission.  

This is a common side-quest formula, used widely with some variations across games with similar high-level design systems (The Witcher 3, Horizon Zero Dawn, Spiderman...etc, etc.)


#### Minor Side-Quest Level Design and "Arenas"

![entry](./images/ghost-of-tsushima/cost-of-iron/entry.png){: .post-image}

I'm sure the developers have a specific term for "combat areas", but I'll be using "arena."  

An arena is a contained area with enemies, obstacles, and a central objective. Arenas generally have the space for straightforward combat or the layout for and enemy positioning for a stealth approach (tall grass, houses, and other places to hide). Arenas generally have small rewards and ammo refills peppered throughout (arrows, kunai, supplies, etc.).  

Camps, forts, captive villages are all "arenas" of different scales, and they can generally be conquered in a variety of ways. Larger spaces, which are the focus of key missions are often a composition of multiple arenas. Castle Kaneda, for instance, is composed of a few medium-sized spaces filled with its own set of enemies, conquered linearly but with variation at the arena level.  

Continuing with the "Cost of Iron" sidequest, towards the end of the minor side-quest structure the trail empties into a small arena. The place where the trial empties Jin, is one one of the smallest types of arenas (excluding patrol squads that Jin finds while traversing Tsushima).

#### Mythical Side-Quests


## Narrative Structure

3 Acts

[SCRATCHPAD]

One of the interesting dichotomies of the game is Jin's adherence to his samurai code coming up against the pragmatic course of stealth needed to dispatch larger groups.
The game has Jin struggle with this relationship, but as a player, I didn't really care. The story and weight of this 'code' was conveyed, but the game really only had the fight with the mongol leader in the beginning to demonstrate the cons of honorable fighting in the beginning, and that scripted loss felt rather telegraphed.

Sections:
  - Anatomy of sidequest
    - Mythical sidequest
      - Crazy plot centered around the promise of bad-ass reward
      - Intro does a great job of giving player motive and purpose 
    - Trivial sidequest
  - Level design anatomy / recreate
    - "The Cost of Iron"
      - Tracking down a merchant in supposed possession of a iron that allows its carrier to travel safely amongst Mongols
  - Narrative exposition
    - Introduction of "Ghost" mechanics are usually followed by flashback where Jin's upbringing contrasts new skill
