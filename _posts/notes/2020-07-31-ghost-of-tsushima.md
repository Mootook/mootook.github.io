# Ghost of Tsushima [WIP]
---

## Cinematic Visuals - [WIP]
Most aspects of GoT seem in service of its visual style (Akira Kurosawa films)
- No number on leveling up (pros and cons)
- Camera positioning
- Amazing intro that does better than any game in recent memory of setting its tone
- Mission intro screens
- Waypoints (the wind) and guiding markers (birds/foxes) seem to be a nod to the cinematic motion of Kurosawa

Favorite thing about GoT is the subtle 'leveling up', the game allows for. There's a skill tree, but the only indication of experience or player level is the white icon that fills up after missions. Progression feels organic, challenges seem aspirational and not impossible, flush with both the narrative and gameplay.

## Anatomy of Side-Quests

A great chunk of GoT is composed of episodic missions that, for the most part, are tangential to the main story but provide incentive through through material rewards (crafting supplies, armor upgrades, and experience to level up).

There are three "types" of side-quests:  

**Major** -- often multi-part, focusing on the development of a side character's story (Sensei Ishikawa and the hunt for his student Tomoe, for example). These are brought to the player's attention through the narrative progression of the main story. Rewards are usually materials, upgrade components, or, in some cases, key weapons/items/armor.

**Minor** -- self-contained, short missions focusing on external happenings that, if left unattended, don't seem to effect to the main gameplay arc. Often brought to the attention of the player through exploration or guided interaction with the world (broken cart on a main path, or golden bird guiding you to distraught villager).
Rewards include materials and upgrade components.

**Mythical** -- self contained, medium length missions focusing on a ancient legend, centering on a piece of armor or weapon (strong incentive for player). Introduced much like minor quests but only through village musician/story-tellers. Rewards include armor or weapons.

### Mythical Side-Quests



[SCRATCHPAD]

One of the interesting dichotomies of the game is Jin's adherence to his samurai code coming up against the pragmatic course of stealth needed to dispatch larger groups.
The game has Jin struggle with this relationship, but as a player, I didn't really care. The story and weight of this 'code' was conveyed, but the game really only had the fight with the mongol leader in the beginning to demonstrate the cons of honorable fighting in the beginning, and that scripted loss felt rather telegraphed.

Sections:
  - Anatomy of sidequest
    - Mythical sidequest
      - Crazy plot centered around the promise of bad-ass reward
      - Intro does a great job of giving player motive and purpose 
    - Trivial sidequest
  - Level design anatomy / recreate
    - "The Cost of Iron"
      - Tracking down a merchant in supposed possession of a iron that allows its carrier to travel safely amongst Mongols
  - Narrative exposition
    - Introduction of "Ghost" mechanics are usually followed by flashback where Jin's upbringing contrasts new skill
