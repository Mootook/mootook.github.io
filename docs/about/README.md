# About

Hello!

My name is Alex, and this is where I post some coherent-ish ramblings about games and other projects.

You can find a list of these write-ups [here](../notes/) and a list of my projects [here](../projects).

[Here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uW09nQfajSEZplIPRnCt1yDPHCbZDKzMxWdMNYEVL5Q/edit?usp=sharing) is a list of stuff I'm reading.

And [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10Hnk984UEuDFn1OoGUdGaidXpRQMsxKzTFGR8I8XvD0/edit?usp=sharing) is a list of stuff I'm playing.

Also, I spend a decent amount of time studying and learning new things. If you're interested, you can find the repository where I store all of that [here](https://github.com/Mootook/independent-studies/projects/1).

## Contact

If you'd like, you can reach out to me at <alexanderkmutuc@gmail.com>.
