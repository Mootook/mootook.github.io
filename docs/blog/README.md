Shortly after Demon's Souls released in 2009, Hidetaka Miyazaki, was quoted that the goal of their (FromSoftware) games was about providing 
players with a sense of accomplishment. The to-come infamous difficulty of souls as a franchise was simply a byproduct of this design philosophy.
Difficulty, to Miyazaki and thus FromSoftware, was a tool for the designers, a way to enable this unique experience. And the exaggerated nature of a soul's game's difficulty can explain why many players herald them as such unique experiences."
