# Life is Strange: Sound and Presence

So I recently beat the first Life is Strange (LiS) game…And I actually enjoyed it. It was one of those games that had a very specific spot in my daily routine. It was always nice to play at night, to just sit alone and spend an hour or two in Arcadia Bay. It was effortless and peaceful.

Now, I play a variety of different games, but LiS's format still seemed unique to me when I started it. It seemed, at its core, to be a visual novel - which I'm usually not a huge fan of - but its thoughtful pacing, its meaningful decision making system, and great characters all got me invested.  

It is an interesting game, and though it may not be for everyone, LiS has some unique elements that other games could benefit from. One of the biggest things that I'd like to isolate and explore is LiS's use of diegetic and nondiegetic sounds.  

## Diegetic and Nondiegetic Sounds

Diegetic and nondiegetic are terms in film that refer to a particular sound's origin and how it relates to any given scene. Diegetic sound is naturally occurring and audible to the characters - wind, gunshots, people talking, a radio. Diegetic sound belongs within the film's world and is thus processed by characters and viewers alike.
The video below shows a scene from Saving Private Ryan which is comprised pretty much exclusively of diegetic sounds. Everything that you hear in this scene, the characters can also hear.

Diegetic sound creates a sense of presence and, when coupled with the right visuals, can make for an incredibly immersive experience.
Nondiegetic sound, however, represents all of the things that exist in that odd layer between the film's world and the audience. Nondiegetic sound is just sort of layered upon the scene but is inaudible to the characters. A narrator for instance or a movie's score represent nondiegetic elements.
This scene from 2001: A Space Odyssey is well known for having done this using "The Blue Danube."

Pretty much every film will mix these two types of sound to create a dynamic environment of sounds and music, and when successful, the audio can do just as much for a story or experience as the visuals.
Here, WALL-E's opening scene uses a seemingly nondiegetic element as a visual/auditory contrast for exposition and for a bit of character development. Using sound like this is another way to subtly subvert our expectations of a particular scene, making for memorable introductions and plot points.

And here, The Emperor's New Groove uses its opening narration as a bit of fun fourth-wall breaking to introduce us to its main character.

Even the trailer for The Last of Us Part II was clever in the way it handled its sound design and score.

(What a fantastic trailer in my opinion)  

Aaaanyways…LiS is a game that relies pretty heavily on its soundtrack and sound design to embolden its narrative. It doesn't have a deep and complex mechanical system, and so it uses more of these film-like techniques to keep players invested.  

Most games, of course, will have layered sound design that is contextually flush - think of every lute player in Skyrim alongside the dozens of talking people and soundtrack in the background - but LiS blurs that line between diegetic and nondiegetic so well.
During my time with LiS, there was less of a distinction between game play and cut scenes because of how sound was able to transition me between the two - and the fact that LiS often gave me a way to control the sound and music meant that I could, at times, create my own cut scenes, my own moments to reflect and relax.  

This scene right here was one of my favorites - just lying around with your friend, listening to music, wanting to figure out the mysteries of Arcadia Bay. The game even gives you a way to end it - cut it short by pressing "B" - I just had almost no incentive to get up because of how peaceful this moment felt in-game. The world is comprised of some horrible people…so why not take a second to breathe before saving it?

By having a soundtrack that not only fits with the mood and atmosphere of a particular scene but is also alive within the scene - something that is affecting the characters and player simultaneously - LiS is able to draw players deeper into the world before them.
For me, it was consistently difficult to maintain emotional distance from the events and characters of LiS - one of the biggest factors in that, in my opinion, was the lack of defined layers in the sound design. Songs were atmospheric, fitting with the larger emotional arc, and, best of all, they were often naturally occurring within the world, which made them feel organic and believable. The music positioned me relative to Max or Chloe instead of the game's world. Rather than having the music queue in a dramatic sequence or hint at a plot twist, the music was a way to make the player/avatar (me/Max) relationship more intimate. The music, like the confrontations and time-warps, was just another thing we experienced together.  

Well, that's how I feel about it all. Unfortunately, literature that dives into the specific effects of the varied forms of sound and music is rare - even around film.
This may seem like a really small point to get caught up on, but it's one of those small things that I just noticed and clung to because of how much better it made my experience with LiS.  

Also, yes, some of this is inherent within the structure and context of the game - like, no shit…of course you can turn on the radio whenever you want, there are radios almost everywhere - your dorm, Chloe's room, etc. And these comprise most of the game's settings. (There's no lute player following you in the wilderness or dungeons of Skyrim!) And the pace of the game means you can kick it with your Hi-Fi whenever you want. There are no active enemies or time limits. Yet even still, I think that this could comprise one technique that game designers could implement.  

Music can be an incredible tool for a story's structure and progression. It's a great tool for pacing, exposition, and character development. But in video games your pace and story are reliant on the plaayer, and being reliant on the player means constructing situations that encourage engagement with these elements. LiS was aided by its simple mechanics and story-heavy format, but the way it used music to connect players and characters should not be something unique to LiS or even its genre.
I do think that this line - between forms of sound - is something that other games could try looking into or experimenting with. It can, as is so obvious throughout Arcadia Bay, do wonders for immersion and narrative.
