# Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice - Space, Props, and The Guardian Ape


![title-card](https://i.imgur.com/Wh2tUg9.jpg)


## Intro

Shortly after Demon's Souls released in 2009, Hidetaka Miyazaki was quoted that the goal of their (FromSoftware) games was about providing players with a sense of accomplishment. The to-come infamous difficulty of souls as a franchise was simply a byproduct of this design philosophy.
Difficulty, to Miyazaki and thus FromSoftware, was a tool for the designers, a way to enable this experience. Since they've become more and more popular, the games have been heralded for the unique experiences they deliver, and it's largely due to this level of difficulty.

If that goal of FromSoftware has stayed consistent through the years, then Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice has a difficulty on par with the studio's primary intentions. Sekiro and other souls games differ greatly in many of their design aesthetics, worlds, and mechanics. These differences are a write-up analysis on their own, but even still, the fact that Sekiro and its predecessors share this core tenant inextricably binds the experiences each game delivers. This creates an unfortunate issue when discussing Sekrio: analyses of Sekiro are often done through a lens experienced with Dark Souls and the "souls formula" that resulted from three successful iterations. When so much of the game is about being difficult, it's hard to identify game design aspects independent of how they operate in other souls games.

But despite their differences, Sekiro and Souls seem to share the goal of creating a sense of accomplishment for the player -- or rather, creating the circumstances and obstacles so that players can create/find that sense on their own. And certainly, as I've played through different entries in the franchise, I've noticed the feelings evoked are similar: pride, accomplishment, and some residual anxiety.

For me, boss fights (which are a staple of every souls-like game, including Sekiro) are a specific and essential implementation of this design choice/goal.
They are concentrated challenges, the relative peaks of difficulty within the overarching experience curve. They can punctuate long, difficult gauntlets or even act as story beats or pillars for world building.

Sekiro, I believe, uses bosses well to these effects.

Many of them made me rage. The fight with Genichiro Ashina, atop Ashina Castle, made me quit the game for nearly a year. Some, like the Divine Dragon or the Headless, made me sad or terrified. Yet by and large, I found most of them to be memorable -- singular, unique experiences from which I could derive how I felt before, during, and after the fight.

A lot of boss fights throughout the souls games, including Sekiro, can bring forth a "well, that's bullshit" reaction. It's when the game makes an exception in its own internal logic at the expense of the player. Why, for instance, does my sword hit a wall, but this boss, four times as large as I can kill me from another room? The souls games already have a niche, hardcore following, largely because of how difficult and isolating their core mechanics are, and thus there's the common tendency to shoo these observations away. "Well, that's souls games for ya" or "just get good" are more than just consistent phrases amongst players; they inform judgement on a game's quality and the affordances allowed by the player within the logic constructed by the game itself. From my own perspective, as well, the pride I feel from having beaten these games retroactively stunts my ability to analyze encounters and their relative strengths.

With time and the palette cleansers of some other titles, I've tried going back and thinking of what boss fights have stayed with me and why. Top of the list is the Guardian Ape. The Guardian Ape, I believe, is one of the most memorable boss fights not just in Sekiro but in any game I've ever played, and I believe it's worth looking into for a number of reasons. It's a memorable boss fight, but why? It's not like there's a fundamental alteration in how the game is played. The player has access to many of the same tools at this point in the game as any other, with the exception of some passive upgrades and a bigger health bar. It's not the "most difficult", nor is it completed in some unique way. While it punctuates a major story beat, so do many other boss fights that didn't stick with me (The Owl, for instance). It's not the fact that fighting a big monkey is more interesting than fighting a really strong human because the fight against the two guardian apes wasn't all that memorable.

And while one could strongly reduce why I remember this encounter to just preference, I think a lot of what makes the Guardian Ape great comes down to a combination of level, story, and combat design. Even if it is just preference, it's still helpful to understand what design elements cater to certain preferences and how these ideas hold to bosses of varying styles and aesthetics.

## Level Layout and Space

In Sekiro, the layout is often part of the challenge. The type of terrain, how narrow, how bright, usually all work in unison with the types of enemies you're pitted against.
And rarely are these elements employed to make things easier. Rather areas often enhance the strengths of enemies, bait the player into choke-points so they face numerous enemies, put you in small spaces against aggressive foes, etc.

As Mark Brown puts it in his analysis of DS1:

>  "The ideal way to play Dark Souls is to move slowly and carefully and fight enemies on one-on-one bouts, where you have lots of room to move, but the level design and enemy placement does everything to mess with this." 

And while Sekiro is not Dark Souls -- the ideal way is arguably the opposite of slowly and carefully -- it inherits this design "principle." Layouts, enemy type and placement are all working to create a specific type of challenge.

This holds true for bosses.

The arena in which you fight a boss, or mini-boss in some instances, is generally an extension of the boss fight (Of course the bull who blindly charges you is in a narrow passage). Navigating the space provided is the secondary or implicit challenge that comes with trying to kill them.

<p style="padding-left: 2rem;">
    One of the hardest bosses for me, "Lone Shadow Masanaga the Spear-Bearer, seen here
    about to kick in a narrow room.
    Here the limited space is the most significant challenge of this fight, accentuating the boss's striking kick and generally
    aggressive attack pattern.
</p>
<div style="background-color: gray; width: 100%; height: 1px; margin-bottom: 1rem;"></div>

What I love about the Guardian Ape fight is the space. There's quite a few areas in Sekiro where you have ample space to fight someone/thing -- Gyoubu Oniwa, Lady Butterfly -- and it makes for an epic setting. In scale alone, it feels special that the world has allotted you such a significant amount of space to fight, important that they control and are defending such a large swath of territory from you. In visuals alone, space can show how large a boss is relative to that player simply by showing how much room each one occupies in a given arena.

In the case of the Guardian Ape, the amount of space is both necessary, and it makes sense for the boss's design. The Guardian Ape is fast and aggressive. It has a large variety of attacks, and almost all of them cover a large amount of area. The game provides the player with an open, mostly empty space because of this. Beating the boss requires recognizing animations and spacing just outside the Guardian Ape, which is only possible because the arena provides the player space and movement options in order to orbit and properly approach the fight.

The arena's scale and space provide safety but in a precarious, engaging way. While the Guardian Ape's arena is one of the largest out of any boss fight, you're never quite safe, and thus the interactions rarely feel static. His speed, aggression, and move variety ensure that distance doesn't equate to safety. On the one hand, this provides the players with some breathing room, and space affords more escape and attack routes for the player, yet because it's partnered with a boss that can traverse the space quickly and aggressively, it keeps an undercurrent of uncertainty and thus engagement.

Another reason why the space here seems to work is because of how it contrasts a lot of Sekiro's other bosses. Sekiro has no shortage of cramped, uncomfortable boss fights. The fight with the Guardian Ape is probably the "largest" up to this point. In both space and enemy design, the Guardian Ape is quite different from anything the player has encountered thus far in the game. It pounds its fist, rolls around, leaps towards you, throws literal shit at you when you run away, each of its moves flowing into the next so that it's hard to predict what's coming next, hard to judge the moment when you can move in for your singular strike before running away again. The space emphasizes this attack pattern and move-set. It makes them possible, and it does so while dwarfing the player.

![ape](https://i.imgur.com/k0Cc2g7.jpg)

In stark contrast, one of my least favorite experiences in any souls game was fighting the Capra Demon. He's not only easy once you know what to, but he almost ceases to *be* a boss because of how one can defeat him. I believe it's derived from the fact that the space isn't flush with the enemy. Its swords are too large for the space, there's two guard dogs inside (why are they not patrolling, aren't they cramped?), and the seemingly random staircase feels like the game is narrowing my attention, when I'd just like the freedom to figure this fight out. Yes, the staircase provides a safe haven, but then it's revealed that the Capra demon can kinda climb it before falling down and trying again, which really breaks the illusion that I'm fighting a conscious entity. There's no decision making relative to the boss. If I can just hide in this corner, wait for him fall then hit him and do it all again, why wouldn't I always do that? There's no decision making relative to the boss's patterns or level with the exception of his failed jump attack. It's not the fact that it's a cramped fight that makes me dislike it, nor is the Capra Demon and two dogs a bad enemy design, it's that the elements chosen seem incompatible and imbalanced.

<VideoFrame videoUrl="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LN74ocuBark" />

Cramped and uncomfortable then spacious and precarious -- Sekiro has boss's on both sides of the spectrum and each is used to create a distinct feeling. In my mind, the Guardian Ape is one of the best fights across the board because of how it plays to its strengths. The concept of space isolated as a design element is not enough to make or break a boss fight, nor is it just the Guardian Ape as a boss, it's the unification of the two, and how they enhance one another. 

## Props

Another element of the space provided by the boss fight is the collection of things or environmental elements: rocks, trees, pots, whatever. In the general game world of Sekiro, these aren't really a problem. Just go around or over, but in a boss fight, where one's attention has been narrowed to a concentrated set of interactions, these elements can often make or break a fight, and in repeated, unbeaten sprees, change what becomes memorable or stands out from a boss fight.

For me, one of the most prominent examples is the fight against Father Gascoigne in Bloodborne. It is mostly made challenging by the tombstones and poles about the area. You can't spam dodge in this fight. Not only do you have to time your dodge to the boss's attack animations, you have to quickly glance at your character's periphery and make a quick judgement about which way has the most space.

<div style="float: right; width: 50%; padding: 1rem;">
    <img src="https://i.imgur.com/Tps9zaX.png" />
</div>


This relationship isn't a bad thing. It makes for an interesting dynamic and forces the player to juggle more variables. In response many of the bosses in such arenas have distinct directional attacks so that dodging in at least one direction works. In games like Bloodborne or Dark Souls (mostly Dark Souls), a lot of bosses err more towards this structure because it is in sync with the combat and movement mechanics: slow and caluclated.

Sekiro's verticality and tempo mostly push the usage of "props" in creating challenging spaces towards the annoying (why grant the player incredible speed and the ability to jump and grapple hook across a level if you're just going to enclose them during every significant encounter). Because of this, there aren't many cases where navigating about props is a significant factor. A lot of Sekiro's boss arenas are just flat, empty arenas with a few poles for safety. The Guardian Ape, as well, features only a few trees about the level. They aren't jumbled closely, and they aren't wide enough so that when you bump up against them you stop moving. Additionally, the player can grapple hook onto these and fly across the arena, furthering the mobility and scale provided by the space. The lack of props serves to focus the attention of the player on the boss fight. Adding giant rocks or small tree clusters in the level could create scenarios antithetical to the strengths of the Guardian Ape's fight: speed and scale. They would also provide a false sense of security like in some other fights and encourage the player to hide (like the first fight against the Shichimen Warrior), whereas so much of this fight about movement and spacing.


Another small point about limiting the amount of stuff in a level: the camera has less to account for, less things it needs to make translucent or orbit about. This is a little hard to explain, and I didn't recognize it as something until I encountered it handled poorly (or perhaps intentionally to my frustration). The fight with the True Corrupted Monk takes place on a narrow, scenic bridge, but if you fight in the center, which feels natural as it's more difficult to fight and move against the walls on either side of the bridge, there's a tree that looms over the player and into the foreground, obstructing the view, distracting the player from the fight.

![true-monk](https://i.imgur.com/SRpFffc.jpg)

Yeah, it's pretty. But it adds a frustrating variable. It's a weird translucent tree branch across your screen. It's not an interesting decision for the player -- perhaps because it divides the relationship between the player character and the player. The tree branch isn't something that your character can jump around or consider in the next movement. A giant pole I accidentally dodged into? Yeah, makes sense, that would annoy both the Wolf and me, and when I come back, hopefully I'll have the mental dexterity to take it into consideration. Yet the giant tree branch only obstructs your, the player's, view and thus the entrance into this fantasy. It's almost like cluttered UI -- separate from the game world and annoying simply because it's there.

This point also brings up a common problem in souls games: the camera. There is a common joke about the internet about the camera in FromSoftware games being the hardest boss, always there when you get pressed into a corner, orbiting at such an awkward angle you panic, lose focus, and ultimately die. Aggressive bosses force you into corners, make you feel at a disadvantage. Fights with them are claustrophobic, filled with pressured anxiety. The squished and unbalanced camera emphasizes this.

In larger spaces, such as with the Guardian Ape, this isn't too much of a problem. Even with large, aggressive bosses, space gives the player options, mitigating the risk they get pressed against a wall and watch the camera orbit into an unnatural, uncomfortable angle.

In summation, the space and simplicity of the Guardian Ape's arenas work to emphasize the boss's strengths of speed and aggression while rightly mitigating the usage of challenging environmental elements and tight corridors.

## Context

Sometimes when playing games, I'll see an NPC or a boss and think "odd...why are you here?" And the reason varies from game to game and from NPC to NPC. When it happens, it can often break the fantasy of the game's world. And I'd bet that most people who've played through a video game can identify with this thought. Sometimes you'll stroll into a room, an empty, unimportant room, and there's just a large knight waiting to kill you. Why are you even here? Is this a very important room?

In instances like this, the enemy seems of the *game* and not of the *game world*. There was a space in the game, and it needed to be populated with an enemy, and so sticks were drawn.

I have this thought every time I see Havel the Rock, the tank of a boss sitting in the basement of the watch tower in DS1. He's so damn strong, and I'm not entirely sure what he's guarding -- me getting into Darkroot Basin? The giant rock things getting into the Undead Burg? Why wasn't there someone slightly below his level preceding him?If he is defending the tower, is this really the best spot to do that? Is there a cool treasure chest in here? An important NPC over there? Does he like it here in the musty room? There's probably some reason buried in the souls lore, but regarding what the game presents me, there doesn't seem to be a justification for his being right there. Why is such a strong enemy guarding such a small dark room? (Though, sidenote, I don't think the level is a bad choice for this fight. I actually think it works.)

![havel](https://i.imgur.com/hvyQxha.jpg)

I'm nit-picking of course. Souls games have a lot of tough enemies, and they can't possibly imbue every space with relevance relative to its inhabitants, but encounters feel significant when they are of the world and feel like they are taking place in it and not because of how the game is guiding you through it. The fights themselves don't need to be grand or built for the enemy, but the encounter and its occupants should, if only slightly, provide some justification for each other. Immersive and rich worlds, to me, often feel realized if they seem that they could exist independent of the player -- NPCs, enemies, and places would still be there whether the player did or didn't decide to venture through it all.

I've heard the argument that Dark Souls has "harder" enemies to justify. Its more cryptic story, fantastical setting, and less obvious method of world building and storytelling do not lend themselves naturally to explanation and thus contextual justifications for the existence of particular enemies in particular spaces. Whereas many of Sekiro's encounters occur in a war zone, a blanket justification for the presence of almost any kind of enemy. Yet, the justification, I believe can be small, purely aesthetic. I've already bought into the game world, so as long as the explanations are consistent, then I generally don't notice. It could be as simple as limiting the amount of light in a space with more terrifying enemies (i.e. the Headless from Sekiro).

Zelda games, for example, have some fantastical, varied environments and enemies, yet it layers these elements with thematic level/dungeon design that compounds up to the final boss who is a manifestation of those narrative and aesthetic facets. Undertale uses humor, which is seen as consistent in the universe's absurdity to explain "out of place" NPCs.

</div>


Anyways, I bring this up because I think not handling it well can create a hiccup in the engagement of a video game's world. Take, the Shichimen Warrior for example. When it's first encountered, it's in a creepy, dark cave. The player is given space to run around and dodge its loud and horrifying spirit cannon, which quite literally scares you to death on contact. Yet the projectiles are also a bright, beautiful purple, and one of your only light sources in the fight. Not my favorite fight, but it makes sense. Dark, scary cave -- yea, probably has a dancing spirit monster that shoots the faces of the undead at you. Checks out.

Yet in Fountainhead Palace, there's another one at the base of a waterfall. I understand this place has a connection to the spiritual plane and is of another dimension in ways, but why, with all of its elements handled so well in the cave, is it tucked in this narrow, bright passage? It's pretty much the exact same fight, but in one it felt like an inhabitant of the space, a guardian that the player is pitted against. Here the fight feels awkward and a bit frustrating, like neither of us want to be here.

<div style="display: grid; grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr; gap: 0.25rem;">

</div>


These may be small points to get caught up, but for me they can tip the balance of a boss being "difficult but pretty cool" to "difficult and annoying." The Guardian Ape's context, I believe, is handled very well in multiple ways, and its place in the timeline and game world cemented the fight in my memory.

The first is that the Guardian Ape is, go figure, guarding something from the player. Without this item, the player cannot proceed. It can be argued that all bosses block the player's progress in Sekiro. Yet how and why, I believe, is the distinguishing idea here. Take, for example, Taurus Demon, Cleric Beast, True Corrupted Monk. They all jump in front of the player on narrow bridges, quite bluntly blocking progression. For the boss, the one who in these instances initiates the fight, the bridge makes sense as a chokepoint. The player doesn't happen upon these fights as the boss is collecting tolls from other passersby. The boss isn't surprised to see the player. They're defending entrance into their territory and have decided to jump down at this specific point, seemingly to fight in a location of their choosing, to challenge the player on their terms. Bosses that guard passage in this way are explained by the layout itself. The boss has binarized the world, but even still, it makes sense that they'd fight you then and there.

In the case of the Guardian Ape, this conflict around progression is manifested as an item. This type of conflict is just as common as the bridge, but it's explained or justified to the player differently.

Look below at how the fight is introduced:

![ape-entrance](https://i.imgur.com/Ej9l1VU.jpg)

The Guardian Ape is not facing the player. Against the mountain wall, it's almost invisible, not really obstructing much of the frame. It's hunched over. Its back is to you, assumedly tending to and watching over the Lotus of the Palace (the item you happen to need). In place alone, regardless of the player's actions, the Guardian Ape is here tending to its flower at the bottom of this valley. It has a comfortable amount of space and a narrow, singular entrance which makes guarding this space simpler. Its purpose as a guardian is flush with the space it has decided to watch over. It's not solely protecting the Lotus from the player, it's protecting it from everything in this world.

There's no doubt that the Guardian Ape would react to any intruder as it did to the player. And here, in contrast to "bridge" bosses, the player has to initiate the fight. The player has to decide when it begins. If you didn't need this item, you wouldn't have to encroach on its territory. It doesn't go out of its way to fight or hunt you, nor does it spring from an unseen branch to challenge you. It fights you because you want to fight it, same would happen with anything that challenged it. With this, the fight feels organic, created by the player and has a sense of place, as if many before you have tried and failed to rob the Ape of its treasure.

Another interesting concept used in the level for the Guardian Ape (much of the Sunken Valley feels like it was built for this boss), are the monkey enemies used as a means of foreshadowing. The entire level leading up to the boss is populated with small monkeys hanging from branches, huddled in groups, that'll attack the player if they get too close. Once the Guardian Ape has been encountered, the monkeys make even more sense in their belonging to this place -- small minions ridding the valley of pests that aren't even strong enough to face the Ape, minions that may one day grow up to be the next Guardian Apes.

![monkeys](https://i.imgur.com/8aKsFRL.jpg)

In many ways, this design element is reminiscent of Quelaag from DS1. At the bottom of Blight-town, everyone's favorite place, the most common enemy is a creepy, fire/lava breathing spider. Then in the distance, past the poisonous muck, there's a mountain of cobwebs, and within it, the largest of the fire/lava breathing spiders -- Quelaag herself, the boss that punctuates this part of the game. It's not the most engaging fight, but the usage of minions leading up to her, an environment that reflected her impact and status, added to the sense of scale and importance, as if I really were fighting the strongest beast in this area, one that every creature in this world with me feared and respected.

None of these points are to stagger different explanations used for different bosses. Not every enemy can have an entire section of the game world carved out and molded for their benefit. The point is that *explained* boss fights always feel better. I also just find it interesting how each creates a sense of purpose in the game world relationship between the boss and the player. Why some fights happen and how many others don't because of how and when the player ventured through the world.
