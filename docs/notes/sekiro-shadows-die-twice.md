# Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice - Space, Props, and The Guardian Ape


![title-card](https://i.ibb.co/W2K2Bcn/guardianape-02.jpg)


## Intro

Shortly after Demon's Souls released in 2009, Hidetaka Miyazaki, was quoted that the goal of their (FromSoftware) games was about providing 
players with a sense of accomplishment. The to-come infamous difficulty of souls as a franchise was simply a byproduct of this design philosophy.
Difficulty, to Miyazaki and thus FromSoftware, was a tool for the designers, a way to enable this unique experience. And the exaggerated nature of a soul's game's difficulty can explain why many players herald them as such unique experiences.

If that goal of FromSoftware has stayed consistent through the years, then Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice has a difficulty meant to enhance this intended experience.
Sekiro and other souls games differ greatly in many of their design aesthetics, worlds, and mechanics. These differences are a write-up analysis on their own, but even still, they create an unfortunate issue when discussing Sekiro, which is that analyses of Sekiro are often through a lens experienced with Dark Souls and the "souls formula" that resulted from three successful iterations. It's hard to identify game design aspects independent of how they operated in other souls games.

But despite their differences, Sekiro and Souls seem to share the goal of creating a sense of accomplishment for the player. Or rather, creating the circumstances and obstacles so that players can create/find that sense on their own.

For me, boss fights (which are a staple of every souls-like game, including Sekiro) are a specific and essential implementation of this design choice/goal.
They are concentrated challenges, the relative peaks of difficulty within the overarching experience curve. They can punctuate long, difficult gauntlets or even act as story beats for narrative purposes.

Sekiro, I believe, uses bosses well to this effect.

Many of them made me rage. The fight with Genichiro Ashina, atop Ashina Castle, made me quit the game for nearly a year. Some, like the Divine Dragon or the Headless, made me sad or terrified. Yet by and large, I found most of them to be memorable -- singular, unique experiences from which I could derive how I felt at the time and the feeling after.

The Guardian Ape, I believe, is one of the most memorable boss fights not just in Sekiro but in any game I've ever played, and I believe it's worth looking into for a number of reasons. It's a memorable boss fight, but why? It's not like there's a fundamental alteration in how the game is played. The player has access to many of the same tools at this point in the game as any other, with the exception of some passive upgrades and a bigger health bar. It's not the "most difficult", nor is it completed in some unique way. While it punctuates a major story beat, so do many other boss fights that didn't stick with me (The Owl, for instance). It's not the fact that fighting a big monkey is more interesting than fighting a really strong human, because the fight against the two guardian apes wasn't all that memorable.

A lot of boss fights throughout the souls games, including Sekiro, can bring forth a "well, that's bullshit" reaction. It's when the game makes an exception in its own internal logic at the expense of the player. Why, for instance, does my sword hit a wall, but this boss, four times as large as I can kill me from another room? The souls games already have a niche, hardcore following, largely because of how difficult and isolating their core mechanics are, and thus there's the common tendency to shoo these observations away. "Well, that's souls games for ya" or "just get good" are more than just consistent phrases amongst players; they inform judgement on a game's quality and the affordances allowed by the player. In my own perceptions, as well, the pride I feel from having beaten these games retroactively stunts my ability to analyze encounters and their relative strengths.

With time and the palette cleansers of some other titles, I've tried going back and thinking of what boss fights have stayed with me and why. Top of the list is the Guardian Ape. And while one could strongly reduce why I remember this encounter to just "preference," I think a lot of what makes the Guardian Ape unique comes down to a combination of level, story, and combat design.

## Level Layout and Space

In Sekiro, the layout is often part of the challenge. The type of terrain, how narrow, how bright, usually all work in unison with the types of enemies you're pitted against.
And rarely are these elements employed to make things easier. Rather areas often enhance the strengths of enemies, bait the player into choke-points so they face numerous enemies, put you in small spaces against aggressive foes, etc.

As Mark Brown puts it in his analysis of DS1:

>  "The ideal way to play Dark Souls is to move slowly and carefully and fight enemies on one-on-one bouts, where you have lots of room to move, but the level design and enemy placement does everything to mess with this." 

And while Sekiro is not Dark Souls -- the ideal way is arguably the opposite of slowly and carefully -- it inherits this design "principle." Layouts, enemy type and placement are all working to create a specific type of challenge.

This holds true for bosses.

The arena in which you fight a boss, or mini-boss in some instances, is generally an extension of the boss fight (Of course the bull who blindly charges you is in a narrow passage). Navigating the space provided is the secondary or implicit challenge that comes with trying to kill them.

    One of the hardest bosses for me, "Lone Shadow Masanaga the Spear-Bearer, seen here

    Here the limited space is the most significant challenge of this fight, accentuating the boss's striking kick and generally
    aggressive attack pattern.

What I love about the Guardian Ape fight is the space. There's quite a few areas in Sekiro where you have ample space to fight someone/thing -- Gyoubu Oniwa, Lady Butterfly -- and it makes for an epic setting. In scale alone, it feels special that the world has allotted you such a significant amount of space to fight, important that they control and are defending such a large swath of territory from you. In visuals alone, space can show how large a boss is relative to that player simply by showing how much room each one occupies in a given arena.

In the case of the Guardian Ape, the amount of space is both necessary, and it makes sense for the boss's design. The Guardian Ape is fast and aggressive. It has a large variety of attacks, and almost all of them cover a large amount of area. The game provides the player with an open, mostly empty space because of this. Beating the boss requires recognizing animations and spacing just outside the Guardian Ape, which is only possible because the arena provides the player space to orbit, movement options to properly approach the fight.

The arena's scale and space provide safety but in a precarious, engaging way. While the Guardian Ape's arena is one of the largest out of any boss fight, you're never quite safe, and thus the interactions rarely feel static. His speed, aggression, and move variety ensure that distance doesn't equate to safety. On the one hand, this provides the players with some breathing room, and space affords more movement options, yet because it's partnered with a boss that can traverse the space quickly and aggressively, it keeps an undercurrent of uncertainty and thus engagement.

Another reason why the space here seems to work is because of how it contrasts a lot of Sekiro's other bosses. Sekiro has no shortage of cramped, uncomfortable boss fights. The fight with the Guardian Ape is probably the "largest" up to this point. In both space and enemy design, the Guardian Ape is quite different from anything the player has encountered thus far in the game. It pounds its fist, rolls around, leaps towards you, throws literal shit at you when you run away, each of its moves flowing into the next so that it's hard to predict what's coming next, hard to judge the moment when you can move in for your singular strike before running away again. The space emphasizes this attack pattern and move-set. It makes them possible, and it does so while dwarfing the player.

In stark contrast, one of my least favorite experiences in any souls game was fighting the Capra Demon. He's not only easy once you know what to, but he almost ceases to *be* a boss because of how one can defeat him. I believe it's derived from the fact that the space isn't flush with the enemy. Its swords are too large for the space, there's two guard dogs inside (why are they not patrolling, aren't they cramped?), and the seemingly random staircase feels like the game is narrowing my attention, when I'd just like the freedom to figure this fight out. Yes, the staircase provides a safe haven, but then it's revealed that the Capra demon can kinda climb it before falling down and trying again, which really breaks the illusion that I'm fighting a conscious entity. There's no decision making relative to the boss. If I can just hide in this corner, wait for him fall then hit him and do it all again, why wouldn't I always do that? There's no decision making relative to the boss's patterns or level with the exception of his failed jump attack. It's not the fact that it's a cramped fight that makes me dislike it, nor is the Capra Demon and two dogs a bad enemy design, it's that the elements chosen seem incompatible and imbalanced.

Cramped and uncomfortable then spacious and precarious -- Sekiro has boss's on both sides of the spectrum and each is used to create a distinct feeling. In my mind, the Guardian Ape is one of the best fights across the board because of how it plays to its strengths. The concept of space isolated as a design element is not enough to make or break a boss fight, nor is it just the Guardian Ape as a boss, it's the unification of the two, and how they enhance one another. 

## Props

Another element of the space provided by the boss fight is the collection of things or environmental elements: rocks, trees, pots, whatever. In the general game world of Sekiro, these aren't really a problem. Just go around or over, but in a boss fight, where one's attention has been narrowed to a narrow set of interactions, these elements can often make or break a fight, and in repeated, unbeaten sprees, change what becomes memorable or stands out from a boss fight.

For me, one of the most prominent examples is the fight against Father Gascoigne in Bloodborne. It is mostly made challenging by the tombstones and poles about the area. You can't spam dodge in this fight. Not only do you have to time dodge in time with the boss's attack animations, you have to quickly glance at your character's periphery and make a quick judgement about which way has the most space.

![bloodborne-father](https://i.ibb.co/ZzhLwZq/bloodborne-father.png)

This relationship isn't a bad thing. It makes for an interesting dynamic and forces the player to juggle more variables. In response many of bosses don't have distinct directional attacks so that dodging in at least one direction works. In games like Bloodborne or Dark Souls, a lot of bosses err more towards this structure because it is in sync with the combat and movement mechanics.

Sekiro's verticality and tempo mostly push the usage of "props" in creating challenging spaces towards the annoying (why grant the player incredible speed and the ability to jump and grapple hook across a level if you're just going to enclose them during every significant encounter). Because of this aren't many cases where navigating about props is a significant factor. A lot of Sekiro's boss arenas are just flat, empty arenas with a few poles for safety. The Guardian Ape, as well, features only a few trees about the level. They aren't jumbled closely and they aren't wide enough so that when you bump up against them you stop moving. The lack of props serves to focus the attention of the player on the boss fight. Adding giant rocks or small tree clusters in the level could create scenarios antithetical to the strengths of the Guardian Ape's fight: speed and scale. They would also falsely provide a sense of security as in some other fights (hiding behind the rock against the Shichimen Warrior).


Another small point about limiting the amount of stuff in a level: the camera has less to account for, less things it needs to make translucent or orbit about. This is a little hard to explain, and I didn't recognize it as something until I encountered it handled poorly (or perhaps intentionally to my frustration). The fight with the True Corrupted Monk takes place on a narrow, scenic bridge, but if you fight in the center, which feels natural as it's more difficult to fight and move against the walls on either side of the bridge, there's a tree that looms over into the foreground, obstructing the view, distracting from the fight.

![true-monk](https://i.ibb.co/DwrjZ3f/corrupted-monk-tree.jpg)

Yeah, it's pretty. But it adds a frustrating variable. It's a weird translucent tree branch across your screen. It's not an interesting decision for the player -- perhaps because it divides the relationship between the player character and the player. The tree branch isn't something that your character can jump around or consider in the next movement. A giant pole I accidentally dodged into? Yeah, makes sense, that would annoy both the Wolf and me, and when I come back, hopefully I'll have the mental dexterity to take it into consideration. Yet the giant tree branch only obstructs your, the player's, view and thus the entrance into this fantasy. It's almost like cluttered UI -- separate from the game world and annoying simply because it's there.

This point also brings up a common problem in souls games: the camera. There is a common joke about the internet about the camera in FromSoftware games being the hardest boss, always there when you get pressed into a corner, orbiting at such an awkward angle you panic, lose focus, and ultimately die. Aggressive bosses force you into corners, make you feel at a disadvantage, claustrophobic, and anxious. The squished and unbalanced camera emphasizes this.

In larger spaces, such as with the Guardian Ape, this isn't too much of a problem. Even with large, aggressive bosses, space gives the player options, mitigating the risk they get pressed against and watch the camera orbit into an unnatural, uncomfortable angle.

In summation, the space and simplicity of the Guardian Ape's arenas work to emphasize the boss's strengths of speed and aggression while rightly mitigating the usage of challenging environmental elements and tight corridors.

One other interesting point that I enjoy about the Guardian Ape is something that I notice a lot of games handle poorly: context.

## Context

Sometimes when playing games, I'll see an NPC or a boss and think "odd...why are you here." And the reason varies from game to game and from NPC to NPC. When it happens, it can often break the fantasy of the game's world. And I think most people who've played through video games can identify this thought. Sometimes you'll stroll into a room, an empty, unimportant room, and there's just a large knight waiting to kill you. That knight seems of the game and not of the game world. There was a space in the game, and it needed to be populated with any enemy, and so sticks were drawn.

I have this thought every time I see Havel the Rock, the tank of a boss sitting in the basement of the watch tower in DS1. He's so damn strong, and I'm not entirely sure what he's guarding -- me getting into Darkroot Basin? The giant rock things getting into the Undead Burg? Why wasn't there someone slightly below his level preceding him? There's probably some reason buried in some souls lore, but regarding what the game presents me, there doesn't seem to be a justification for his being right there. Why is such a strong enemy guarding such a small dark room? (Though, sidenote, I don't think the level is a bad choice for this fight. I actually think it works.)

I'm nit-picking of course. Souls games have a lot of tough enemies, and they can't possibly imbue every space with relevance relative to its inhabitants, but encounters feel significant when they are of the world and feel like they are taking place in it. The fights themselves don't need to be grand or built for the enemy, but the encounter and its occupants should, if only slightly, provide some justification for each other.

I've heard the argument that Dark Souls has "harder" enemies to justify. It's more cryptic story, fantastical setting, and less direct method of world building and storytelling do not lend themselves naturally to explanation and thus contextual justifications for the existence of particular enemies in particular spaces. Whereas many of Sekiro's encounters occur in a war zone, a blanket justification for the presence of almost all of the enemies. Yet, the justification, I believe can be small, purely aesthetic. I've already bought into the game world, so as long as the explanations are consistent, then I generally don't notice.

Anyways, I bring this up because I think not handling it well can create a hiccup in the engagement of a video game's world.

Take, the Schimen Warrior for example. When it's first encountered, it's in a creepy, dark cave. The player is given space to run around and dodge its loud, horrifying spirit cannon, which quite literally scares you to death on contact. Yet it's also a bright, beautiful purple, and one of your only light sources in the fight. Not my favorite fight, but it makes sense. Dark, scary cave. Yes, probably has a dancing spirit monster that shoots the faces of the undead at you. Checks out.

Yet in Fountainhead Palace, there's another one, at the base of a waterfall. I understand this place has a connection to the spiritual plane and is of another dimension in ways, but why, with all of its elements handled so well in the cave, is it tucked in this narrow, bright passage? It's pretty much the exact same fight, but in one it felt like an inhabitant of the space, a guardian that the player is pitted against. The other feels awkward and a bit frustrating.

These may be small points to get caught up, but for me they can tip the balance of a boss being "difficult but pretty cool" to "difficult and annoying."

The Guardian Ape, I believe, is handled very well in multiple ways, and its place in the timeline and game world cemented in my memory.

The first is that the Guardian Ape, go figure, is guarding something from the player. That's it's objective. Blocking the player's progress, in many ways, is the goal of many bosses through the souls games: Taurus Demon, Cleric Beast, True Corrupted Monk -- they all jump in front of the player on narrow bridges, quite bluntly blocking progression. The bridge makes sense as a chokepoint, and progression from one side to other becomes a binary necessity that's easy to funnel players toward, which is why boss's make sense as guardians of passage.

In the case of the Guardian, it's an item. Yet one thing I find really cool is how the fight is initiated.

// he's guarding it from everyone, not just the player

// he's not even facing the right way, he's tending to it!

// guarding

// minions

 (fighting Quelaag, for example, is made great for me solely because of the web that surrounds her cavern, which you have to run into just to initiate the fight). She isn't the most engaging fight, but within the context of the game, I understand why she's there.
