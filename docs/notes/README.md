  description="
Shortly after Demon's Souls released in 2009, Hidetaka Miyazaki, was quoted that the goal of their (FromSoftware) games was about providing 
players with a sense of accomplishment. The to-come infamous difficulty of souls as a franchise was simply a byproduct of this design philosophy.
Difficulty, to Miyazaki and thus FromSoftware, was a tool for the designers, a way to enable this unique experience. And the exaggerated nature of a soul's game's difficulty can explain why many players herald them as such unique experiences."

  description="A great chunk of GoT is composed of episodic missions that, for the most part, are tangential to the main story but provide incentive through material rewards (crafting supplies, armor upgrades), experience to level up, and narrative arcs with supporting characters."

  description="So I recently beat the first Life is Strange (LiS) gameâ€¦And I actually enjoyed it. It was one of those games that had a very specific spot in my daily routine. It was always nice to play at night, to just sit alone and spend an hour or two in Arcadia Bay. It was effortless and peaceful. "
