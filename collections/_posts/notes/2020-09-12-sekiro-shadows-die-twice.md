<h2>Intro</h2>

Shortly after Demon's Souls released in 2009, Hidetaka Miyazaki, was quoted that the goal of their (FromSoftware) games was about providing 
players with a sense of accomplishment. The to-come infamous difficulty of souls as a franchise was simply a byproduct of this design philosophy.
Difficulty, to Miyazaki and thus FromSoftware, was a tool for the designers, a way to enable this unique experience. And the exaggerated nature of a soul's game's difficulty can explain why many players herald them as such unique experiences.

If that goal of FromSoftware has stayed consistent through the years, then Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice has a difficulty meant to enhance this intended experience.
Sekiro and other souls games differ greatly in many of their design aesthetics, worlds, and mechanics. These differences are a write-up analysis on their own, but even still, they create an unfortunate issue when discussing Sekiro: discussing Sekiro is often done through a lens experienced with Dark Souls and the "souls formula" that resulted from three successful iterations. It's hard to not identify game design aspects independent of how they operated in other souls games.

But despite their differences, Sekiro and Souls seem to share the goal of creating a sense of accomplishment for the player. Or rather, creating the circumstances and obstacles so that players can create/find that sense on their own.

For me, boss fights (which are a staple of every souls-like game, including Sekiro) are a specific and essential implementation of this design choice/goal.
They are concentrated challenges, the relative peaks of difficulty within the overarching experience curve. They can punctuate long, difficult gauntlets or even act as story beats for narrative purposes.

Sekiro, I believe, uses bosses well to this effect.

Many of them made me rage. The fight with Genichiro Ashina, atop Ashina Castle, made me quit the game for nearly a year.
Some, like the Divine Dragon or the Headless, made me sad or terrified. Yet by and large, I found most of them to be memorable -- singular, unique experiences from which I could derive how I felt at the time and the feeling after.

The Guardian Ape, I feel, is one of the most memorable boss fights not just in Sekiro but in any game I've ever played, and I believe it's worth looking into for a number of reasons.
It's a memorable boss fight, but why?
It's not like there's a fundamental alteration in how the game is played.
The player has access to many of the same tools at this point in the game as any other, with the exception of some passive upgrades and a bigger health bar.
It's not the "most difficult", nor is it completed in some unique way. While it punctuates a major story beat, so do
many other boss fights that didn't stick with me (The Owl, for instance).
It's not the fact that fighting a big monkey is more interesting than fighting a really strong human, because the fight against the two guardian apes wasn't all that memorable. 
While most of this could probably be reduced to preference, I think a lot of what makes the Guardian Ape unique comes down to a combination of level, story, and combat design.

### Space, Focus, and Context

In Sekiro, the layout is often part of the challenge.
The type of terrain, how narrow, how bright, usually all work in unison with the types of enemies you're pitted against.
And rarely are these elements employed to make things easier. Rather areas often enhance the strengths of enemies,
bait the player into choke-points so they face numerous enemies, put you in small spaces against aggressive foes, etc.

As Mark Brown puts it in his analysis of DS1:

"The ideal way to play Dark Souls is to move slowly and carefully and fight enemies on one-on-one bouts, where you have lots of room to move, but the level design and enemy placement does everything to mess with this." 

And while Sekiro is not Dark Souls -- the ideal way is arguably the opposite of slowly and carefully -- it inherits this design "principle." Layouts, enemy type and placement are all working to create a specific type of challenge.

This holds true for bosses.

The arena in which you fight a boss, or mini-boss in some instances, is generally an extension of the boss fight (Of course the bull who blindly charges you is in a narrow passage). Navigating the space provided is the secondary, or implicit challenge that comes with trying to kill them.

What I love about the Guardian Ape fight is the space. There's quite a few areas in Sekiro where you have ample space to fight someone/thing -- Gyoubu Oniwa, Lady Butterfly -- and it makes for an epic setting. In scale alone, it feels special that the world has allotted you such a significant amount of space to fight, important that they control and are defending such a large swath of territory from you.

In the case of the Guardian Ape, the amount of space is both necessary, and contextually sound (it's a giant ape). In stark contrast, one of my least favorite experiences in any souls game was fighting the Capra Demon. He's easy once you know what to do, but even still, the space isn't flush with the enemy. Its swords are too large for the space, there's two guard dogs inside (why are they not patrolling, aren't they cramped?), and the seemingly random staircase feels like the game is narrowing my attention, when I'd just like the freedom to figure this fight out. Yes, the staircase provides a safe haven, but then its revealed that the Capra demon can kinda climb it before falling down and trying again, which, in my case, really breaks the illusion. There's no decision making relative to the boss. If I can just hide in this corner, wait for him fall then hit him and do it all again, why wouldn't I always do that? There's no decision making relative to the boss's patterns or level with the exception of his failed jump attack. The level and weird enemy choice make for a rather static, chore of a fight.

Scale and space provide safety, but it isn't static. While the Guardian Ape's arena is one of the largest out of any boss fight, you're never quite safe. His speed, aggression, and move variety ensure that distance doesn't equate to safety. It means that I can breathe while being engaged, but even that can change at any second.

Of course, scale isn't applied universally and works largely because of its contrast to Sekiro's large amount of smaller boss fights. Sekiro has no shortage of cramped, uncomfortable boss fights. But here the space does wonders for making the Guardian Ape seems like a larger than life boss. It pounds its fist, rolls around, leaps towards you, throws literal shit at you when you run away, each of its moves flowing into the next so that it's hard to predict what's coming next, when you can move in for your singular strike before running away again. The space emphasizes this attack pattern and moveset. It makes them possible, and it does so while dwarfing the player.

Another element of the space provided by the boss fight is the collection of things or environmental elements: rocks, trees, pots, whatever. In the general game world of Sekiro, these aren't really a problem. Just go around or over, but in a boss fight, where one's attention has been narrowed to a narrow set of interactions, these elements can often make or break a fight, and in repeated, unbeaten sprees, change what stands out in a boss fight.

For me, one of the most prominent examples is the fight against Father Gascoigne in Bloodborne. It is mostly made challenging by the tombstones and poles about the area. You can't spam dodge in this fight. Not only do you have to time dodge in time with the boss's attack animations, you have to quickly glance at your character's periphery and make a quick judgement about which way has the most space.

<< TODO: Father Gascoigne PIC >>

Sekiro's verticality and tempo mostly push the usage of "props" in creating challenging spaces towards the annoying, and there aren't many cases where they're a significant factor. A lot of Sekiro's boss arenas are just flat, empty arenas with a few poles for safety. The Guardian Ape, as well, features only a few trees about the level. They aren't jumbled closely and they aren't wide enough so that when you bump up against them you stop moving. The lack of props serves to focus the attention of the player on the boss fight. Adding giant rocks or small tree clusters in the level could create scenarios antithetical to the strengths of the Guardian Ape's fight: speed and scale. They would also falsely provide a sense of security as in some other fights (hiding behind the rock against the Shichimen Warrior).

Another small point about limiting the amount of stuff in a level: the camera has less to account for, less things it needs to make translucent or orbit about.
This is a little hard to explain, and I didn't recognize it as something until I encountered it handled poorly (or perhaps intentionally frustrating). The fight with the True Corrupted Monk takes place on a narrow, scenic bridge, but if you fight in the center, which feels natural as it's more difficult to fight and move against the walls on either side of the bridge, there's a tree that looms over into the foreground, obstructing the view, distracting from the fight.

<< Tree Corruped Monk Tree PIC >>

Yeah, it's pretty. But it adds a frustrating variable. It's a weird translucent tree branch across your screen. It's not an interesting decision for the player -- perhaps because it divides the relationship between the player character and the player. The tree branch isn't something that your character can jump around or consider in the next movement. It simply obstructs your, the player's, entrance into the fantasy of the game.

This point also brings up a common problem in souls games: the camera. There is a common joke about the internet about the camera in FromSoftware games being the hardest boss, always there when you get pressed into a corner, orbiting at such an awkward angle you panic, lose focus and ultimately die. Aggressive bosses force you into corners, make you feel at a disadvantage, claustrophobic, and anxious. The squished and unbalanced camera emphasizes this.

In larger spaces, such as with the Guardian Ape, this isn't too much of a problem. Even with large, aggressive bosses, space gives the player options, mitigating the risk they get pressed against and watch the camera orbit into an unnatural, uncomfortable angle.

The space and simplicity of the Guardian Ape's arenas work to emphasize the boss's strengths of speed and aggression while also mitigating some of the usual problems of souls bosses of annoying obstructions and awkward camera angles.

Tone this back on the DS1 comparison.
Get right into the boss fight. The focus of this piece si the guardian ape, not what makes sekiro a good game.
Just get straight into it.
Prefacing it with a lengthy comparison takes away. A bit might be necessary to establish my own context for this article but not a lot.

Sekiro, like a lot of souls games, is pretty difficult.

And like a lot of articles about overcoming Sekiro, I'll start by saying, the game was not fun for a while, then, after a painful "aha!" moment, it became impossible to put down. Anyone who's stuck with any of the souls games long enough probably knows the feeling well.
It's pretty great, realizing that the game balances its small margin for error with a polished and predictable combat system. It makes the games challenging and thus rewarding, memorable and, for players like myself who seek out these sorts of experiences in games, fun.
In some ways, the game oscillates between a rhythm game and a puzzle. All enemies have telegraphed attacks, and the player will always have at least one answer to each attack. The puzzle is pairing your arsenal of attacks to the enemy's. After that, it's an execution test. 

I guess everything that feeds into creating this mental model is what constitutes Sekrio's "combat system". It's not just Wolf's (the player's character) move-set and the player's mastery of it, not just the movement or enemy or level design, it's each one's simplicity and relationship to the other that makes for such a compelling gameplay system.

And it's with this combat system that Sekiro is able to challenge the player with creative and memorable boss fights.

Sekiro has some of my favorite boss fights out of any video I've played. With its foundation of a extensible and refined combat system, Sekiro is able to routinely present creative and fresh enemies that test the player's mastery of the game's mechanics. Boss fights, in particular, are areas where the game can narrow its focus on testing a certain skill-set, thereby gradually enhancing the player's connections to the combat system without developing an extensive dependency on the game's skill tree (which, in my opinion would just encourage grinding, something this game, I believe, does well at bypassing).

Instead, boss-fights, force the player to pay attention. Rarely will Sekiro put the player into a situation where their player-character isn't "buff" enough to succeed. You may feel helpless when first encountering a boss, or even a standard enemy in some cases, but its by design that the player doesn't quit after one or two attempts, say "mmmmmmmm, nah, I'm good", and turn the other way to farm souls from earlier parts of the game (ds1 has this problem a bit). It's very much a "just toss 'em in the deep end and hope they learn to swim" kind of approach. You're not going to get past this without fully gripping some core mechanic. Buckle-down, get destroyed for a few rounds, take a deep breath, get destroyed more and begin figuring out why. Any boss of significant difficulty is preceeded by a check-point, so dying rarely has any stakes. Experiment, get destroyed some more, and isolate those small successes.
It's a strategy that can be applied to every boss in the game. Assuming the player hasn't already thrown their controller across the room, they can use this paradigm to approach any boss-fight in the game, 'cept maybe the demon of hatred. that guy sucks. Regardless, that's why it's hard for me to blanket categorize Sekiro as difficult. Yes, it's challenging, but its built on consistency and respect for the combat system.

Because of the verticality afforded to the player in the form of the jump and grappling hook, spaces in Sekiro feel open and wide. 



<h2>Dodge, jump, parry, strike, then probably parry again</h2>
Now that I've gotten that vanilla explanation of why souls-games are so compelling out of the way, it's time to dig into what Sekiro specifically offers the player to survive in this oh so scary world. The game has a skill tree (though there's only a few non-passive options within it that altered my approach to combat), its got some prosthetic tools (though, I'll be honest, I rarely used these), and it's got some consumables that buff your character or provide some quick damage or status ailments to enemies. But other than that, the game's focus, and the milestones throughout it test your mastery of its core gameplay mechanics.
Dodge, jump, block, parry, and strike.
These are the actions available to you at the start. Striking and parrying improve and get extended through the skill tree throughout the game, but generally bosses are beat by reordering these actions, maybe repeating some.
Striking has some variance within itself, but parrying is really just a skilled block. 

Some Sekiro bosses will test the player extensively on one particular mechanic.
The long-arm centipede will test blocking/parrying, for example. Doing pretty much anything else against this creepy thing is useless. I'll be honest in that I died many times trying to dodge and jump, but this boss became much easier when I realized it was a very focused test. The centipede doesn't have much in its arsenal to really combat blocking/parrying. 

![centipede](https://i.ibb.co/378wMHk/centipede.gif){: .post-image}

Other bosses, generally the larger and more memorable ones, test a combination of these focuses, sometimes all at once and sometimes in varying orders and degrees of attention, bosses like Lady Butterfly, Genichiro Ashina, The Corrupted Monk, and, of course, the Guardian Ape.



Notes:
- Space
- Difficulty
- Surprise
- Scale
- The Arena
- Attack variance
- Combat mechanic context
- Unpredictability vs Patterened movement
- guarding something as opposed to bypassing the natural progression (like on a bridge)
- we're taking from the guardian ape, not trying to get past him.
- If the guardian ape is so memorable, why isn't the fight with both of them MORE memorable?
