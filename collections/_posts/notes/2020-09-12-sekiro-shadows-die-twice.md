<h2>Intro</h2>

Shortly after Demon's Souls released in 2009, Hidetaka Miyazaki, was quoted that the goal of their (FromSoftware) games was about providing 
players with a sense of accomplishment. The to-come infamous difficulty of souls as a franchise was simply a byproduct of this design philosophy.
Difficulty, to Miyazaki and thus FromSoftware, was a tool for the designers, a way to enable this unique experience. And the exaggerated nature of a soul's game's difficulty can explain why many players herald them as such unique experiences.

If that goal of FromSoftware has stayed consistent through the years, then Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice has a difficulty meant to enhance this intended experience.
Sekiro and other souls games differ greatly in many of their design aesthetics, worlds, and mechanics. These differences are a write-up analysis on their own. An unforunate issue with discussing Sekiro is that it is often done through a lens experienced with Dark Souls and the "souls formula" that resulted from three successful iterations.

But despite their differences, Sekiro and Souls seem to share the goal of creating a sense of accomplishment for the player. Or rather, creating the circumstances and obstacles so that players can create/find that sense on their own.

For me, boss fights (which are a staple of every souls-like game, including Sekiro) are a specific and essential implementation of this design choice/goal.
They are concentrated challenges, the relative peaks of difficulty within the overarching experience curve. They can punctuate long, difficult guantlets or even act as story beats for narrative purposes.

Sekiro, I believe, uses bosses well to this effect.

Many of them made me rage. The fight with Genichiro Ashina, atop Ashina Castle, made me quit the game for nearly a year.
Some, like the Divine Dragon or the Headless, made me sad or terrified. Yet by and large, I found most of them to be memorable -- singular,
unique experiences from which I could derive how I felt at the time and the feeling of success after.

The Guardian Ape, I feel, is one of the most memorable boss fights not just in Sekiro but in any game I've ever played, and I believe it's worth
looking into for a number of reasons.
It's a memorable boss fight, but why?
It's not like there's a fundamental alteration in how the game is played.
The player has access to many of the same tools at this point in the game as any other, with the exception of some passive upgrades and a bigger health bar.
It's not the "most difficult", nor is it completed in some unique way. While it punctuates a major story beat, so do
many other boss fights that didn't stick with me (The Owl, for instance).
It's not the fact that fighting a big monkey is more interesting than fighting a really strong human, because the fight against the two guardian apes
wasn't all that memorable. 
While most of this could probably be reduced to preference,
I think a lot of what makes the Guardian Ape unique comes down to a combination of level, story, and combat design.

### Space, Focus, and Context

In Sekiro, the layout is often part of the challange.
The type of terrain, how narrow, how bright, usually all work in unison with the types of enemies you're pitted against.
And rarely are these elements employed to make things easier. Rather areas often enhance the strengths of enemies,
bait the player into choke-points so they face numerous enemies, put you in small spaces against agressive foes, etc.

As Mark Brown puts it in his analysis of DS1:

"The ideal way to play Dark Souls is to move slowly and carefully and fight enemies on one-on-one bouts, where you have lots of room to move, but the level design and enemy placement does everything to mess with this." 

And while Sekiro is not Dark Souls -- the ideal way is arguably the opposite of slowly and carefully -- it inherits this design "principle." Layouts, enemy type and placement are all working to create a specific type of challenge.

This holds true for bosses.

Tone this back on the DS1 comparison.
Get right into the boss fight. The focus of this piece si the guardian ape, not what makes sekiro a good game.
Just get straight into it.
Prefacing it with a lengthy comparison takes away. A bit might be necessary to establish my own context for this article but not a lot.

Sekiro, like a lot of souls games, is pretty difficult.

And like a lot of articles about overcoming Sekiro, I'll start by saying, the game was not fun for a while, then, after a painful "aha!" moment, it became impossible to put down. Anyone who's stuck with any of the souls games long enough probably knows the feeling well.
It's pretty great, realizing that the game balances its small margin for error with a polished and predictable combat system. It makes the games challenging and thus rewarding, memorable and, for players like myself who seek out these sorts of experiences in games, fun.
In some ways, the game oscillates between a rhythm game and a puzzle. All enemies have telegraphed attacks, and the player will always have at least one answer to each attack. The puzzle is pairing your arsenal of attacks to the enemy's. After that, it's an execution test. 

I guess everything that feeds into creating this mental model is what constitutes Sekrio's "combat system". It's not just Wolf's (the player's character) move-set and the player's mastery of it, not just the movement or enemy or level design, it's each one's simplicity and relationship to the other that makes for such a compelling gameplay system.

And it's with this combat system that Sekiro is able to challenge the player with creative and memorable boss fights.

Sekiro has some of my favorite boss fights out of any video I've played. With its foundation of a extensible and refined combat system, Sekiro is able to routinely present creative and fresh enemies that test the player's mastery of the game's mechanics. Boss fights, in particular, are areas where the game can narrow its focus on testing a certain skill-set, thereby gradually enhancing the player's connections to the combat system without developing an extensive dependency on the game's skill tree (which, in my opinion would just encourage grinding, something this game, I believe, does well at bypassing).

Instead, boss-fights, force the player to pay attention. Rarely will Sekiro put the player into a situation where their player-character isn't "buff" enough to succeed. You may feel helpless when first encountering a boss, or even a standard enemy in some cases, but its by design that the player doesn't quit after one or two attempts, say "mmmmmmmm, nah, I'm good", and turn the other way to farm souls from earlier parts of the game (ds1 has this problem a bit). It's very much a "just toss 'em in the deep end and hope they learn to swim" kind of approach. You're not going to get past this without fully gripping some core mechanic. Buckle-down, get destroyed for a few rounds, take a deep breath, get destroyed more and begin figuring out why. Any boss of significant difficulty is preceeded by a check-point, so dying rarely has any stakes. Experiment, get destroyed some more, and isolate those small successes.
It's a strategy that can be applied to every boss in the game. Assuming the player hasn't already thrown their controller across the room, they can use this paradigm to approach any boss-fight in the game, 'cept maybe the demon of hatred. that guy sucks. Regardless, that's why it's hard for me to blanket categorize Sekiro as difficult. Yes, it's challenging, but its built on consistency and respect for the combat system.

Because of the verticality afforded to the player in the form of the jump and grappling hook, spaces in Sekiro feel open and wide. 



<h2>Dodge, jump, parry, strike, then probably parry again</h2>
Now that I've gotten that vanilla explanation of why souls-games are so compelling out of the way, it's time to dig into what Sekiro specifically offers the player to survive in this oh so scary world. The game has a skill tree (though there's only a few non-passive options within it that altered my approach to combat), its got some prosthetic tools (though, I'll be honest, I rarely used these), and it's got some consumables that buff your character or provide some quick damage or status ailments to enemies. But other than that, the game's focus, and the milestones throughout it test your mastery of its core gameplay mechanics.
Dodge, jump, block, parry, and strike.
These are the actions available to you at the start. Striking and parrying improve and get extended through the skill tree throughout the game, but generally bosses are beat by reordering these actions, maybe repeating some.
Striking has some variance within itself, but parrying is really just a skilled block. 

Some Sekiro bosses will test the player extensively on one particular mechanic.
The long-arm centipede will test blocking/parrying, for example. Doing pretty much anything else against this creepy thing is useless. I'll be honest in that I died many times trying to dodge and jump, but this boss became much easier when I realized it was a very focused test. The centipede doesn't have much in its arsenal to really combat blocking/parrying.

Other bosses, generally the larger and more memorable ones, test a combination of these focuses, sometimes all at once and sometimes in varying orders and degrees of attention, bosses like Lady Butterfly, Genichiro Ashina, The Corrupted Monk, and, of course, the Guardian Ape.

- Surprise
- Scale
- The Arena
- Attack variance
- Combat mechanic context
- Unpredictability vs Patterened movement
- guarding something as opposed to bypassing the natural progression (like on a bridge)
- we're taking from the guardian ape, not trying to get past him.
- If the guardian ape is so memorable, why isn't the fight with both of them MORE memorable?
