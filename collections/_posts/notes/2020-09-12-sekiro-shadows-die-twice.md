<h2>Intro</h2> 

Sekiro, like a lot of souls games, is pretty difficult.

And like a lot of articles about overcoming Sekrio, I'll start by saying, the game was not fun for a while, then, after a painful "aha!" moment, it became impossible to put down. Anyone who's stuck with any of the souls games long enough probably knows the feeling well.
It's pretty great, realizing that the game balances its small margin for error with a polished and predictable combat system. It makes the games challenging and thus rewarding, memorable and, for players like myself who seek out these sorts of experiences in games, fun.
In some ways, the game oscillates between a rhythm game and a puzzle. All enemies have telegraphed attacks, and the player will always have at least one answer to each attack. The puzzle is pairing your arsenal of attacks to the enemy's. After that, it's an execution test. 

I guess everything that feeds into creating this mental model is what constitutes Sekrio's "combat system". It's not just Wolf's (the player's character) move-set and the player's mastery of it, not just the movement or enemy or level design, it's each one's simplicity and relationship to the other that makes for such a compelling gameplay system.

And it's with this combat system that Sekiro is able to challenge the player with creative and memorable boss fights.

Sekiro has some of my favorite boss fights out of any video I've played. With its foundation of a extensible and refined combat system, Sekiro is able to routinely present creative and fresh enemies that test the player's mastery of the game's mechanics. Boss fights, in particular, are areas where the game can narrow its focus on testing a certain skill-set, thereby gradually enhancing the player's connections to the combat system without developing an extensive dependency on the game's skill tree (which, in my opinion would just encourage grinding, something this game, I believe, does well at bypassing).

Instead, boss-fights, force the player to pay attention. Rarely will Sekiro put the player into a situation where their player-character isn't "buff" enough to succeed. You may feel helpless when first encountering a boss, or even a standard enemy in some cases, but its by design that the player doesn't quit after one or two attempts, say "mmmmmmmm, nah, I'm good", and turn the other way to farm souls from earlier parts of the game (ds1 has this problem a bit). It's very much a "just toss 'em in the deep end and hope they learn to swim" kind of approach. You're not going to get past this without fully gripping some core mechanic. Buckle-down, get destroyed for a few rounds, take a deep breath, get destroyed more and begin figuring out why. Any boss of significant difficulty is preceeded by a check-point, so dying rarely has any stakes. Experiment, get destroyed some more, and isolate those small successes.
It's a strategy that can be applied to every boss in the game. Assuming the player hasn't already thrown their controller across the room, they can use this paradigm to approach any boss-fight in the game, 'cept maybe the demon of hatred. that guy sucks. Regardless, that's why it's hard for me to blanket categorize Sekiro as difficult. Yes, it's challenging, but its built on consistency and respect for the combat system.

<h2>Dodge, jump, parry, strike, then probably parry again</h2>
Now that I've gotten that vanilla explanation of why souls-games are so compelling out of the way, it's time to dig into what Sekiro specifically offers the player to survive in this oh so scary world. The game has a skill tree (though there's only a few non-passive options within it that altered my approach to combat), its got some prosthetic tools (though, I'll be honest, I rarely used these), and it's got some consumables that buff your character or provide some quick damage or status ailments to enemies. But other than that, the game's focus, and the milestones throughout it test your mastery of its core gameplay mechanics.
Dodge, jump, block, parry, and strike.
These are the actions available to you at the start. Striking and parrying improve and get extended through the skill tree throughout the game, but generally bosses are beat by reordering these actions, maybe repeating some.
Striking has some variance within itself, but parrying is really just a skilled block. 

Some Sekiro bosses will test the player extensively on one particular mechanic.
The long-arm centipede will test blocking/parrying, for example. Doing pretty much anything else against this creepy thing is useless. I'll be honest in that I died many times trying to dodge and jump, but this boss became much easier when I realized it was a very focused test. The centipede doesn't have much in its arsenal to really combat blocking/parrying.

Other bosses, generally the larger and more memorable ones, test a combination of these focuses, sometimes all at once and sometimes in varying orders and degrees of attention, bosses like Lady Butterfly, Genichiro Ashina, The Corrupted Monk, and, of course, the Guardian Ape.
