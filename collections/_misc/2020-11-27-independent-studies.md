### Independent Studies

I decided mid 2020 to start plugging in some of my computer science knowledge gaps.

So after a few months of watching tons of unrelated YouTube playlists and failing to work through a few textbooks, I found [OSSU](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science) (Open Source Scoiety University) on GitHub.
I [forked](https://github.com/Mootook/independent-studies) the repo, added some of my own stuff, and started a [project board](https://github.com/Mootook/independent-studies/projects/1). It's got the courses I'm currently enrolled in, textbooks I'm working through, and books I'm reading. I augmented the [reading list](https://github.com/Mootook/independent-studies/blob/main/extras/readings.md) to keep track of game design related readings, and I also added [additional materials](https://github.com/Mootook/independent-studies/blob/main/extras/additional-materials.md) to keep track of various resources I've come across (GDC talks, YouTube channels, podcasts, etc.).
