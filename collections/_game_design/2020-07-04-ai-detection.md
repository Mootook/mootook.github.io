# Design - Ai Detection

---

[WIP]

- Storing some notes on how games signal that enemies are detecting/have detected the player

[Engineering Case Study](/engineering-ai-detection)
### Windaker
- Referring specifically to the forsaken fortress
  - Camera narrows, enemy turns around, jarring sound effect
  - There is no visual indicator
  - You only know if you've gone too far

### Horizon Zero Dawn
- Watcher's detecting Aloy
  - The *detecting* mechanic is purely visual (yellow to red circle that fills up based on level of detection)
  - The *detection* mechanic has sound to communicate that the line has been crossed. Player needs to adapt immediately

### The Last of Us II
- Humans detecting player
  - The *detecting* mechanic is almost always auditory
    - Fits with the tone of the game, the auditory indicator
    - Detection is not only more unsettling. It also feels more vague, as the sound's ascension is not as clear as a visual indicator
- Infected detecting player
  - The *detecting* mechanic is both visual and auditory
    - Clickers will freeze in place and screech if you make too much noise
