## Almost Katamari


### Objective / Inspiration

I've been watching my partner play through [Katamari Damacy](https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/katamari-damacy-reroll-switch/) on the Nintendo Switch lately.
I'd never really played or seen this game, only heard about it as the game where you "the one where you roll a bunch of shit into a ball.".
Interesting.

I tried a level and was thrown off within an instant by the whacky control scheme. It seemed unintuitive and unnecessarily difficult. After a few attempts though, I started to get the hang of it.
I still lost the level and had to hand the controller back to my partner.
We both watched the King of All Cosmos express his immense disappointment in my abilities.
Yet I had become convinced that the controls suited the game. It's a simple game, with a simple objective: roll shit into a ball. And the quirky controls add a bit of learning curve to it, and, for my experience, fed into the katamari chaos.

I then wanted to see if I could mock up the core of Katamari's gameplay. So much of the game is about its other components -- the amazing soundtrack, iconic art, somewhat reflective and deprecating messaging about consumerism, or something. But in essence, I wanted to replicate the core mechanical interaction between the player, the katamari, and all the shit you get to roll-up.

### Beginning

I started the scene by adding some of the usual packages: the new input manager, probuilder, and progrids. I also download this [asset](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/props/interior/polygon-office-low-poly-3d-art-by-synty-159492) (Synty's low poly 3d art) from the unity asset store in preparation for the 'interactable' items I'd like to implement.

With a rigidbody and input handler on the katmari game object, I started by trying to understand the whacky controls.
